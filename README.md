## Put it online (GitHub Pages)
1. On github.com open your repository, then **Add file → Upload files**.
2. Drag in everything from this folder (all files and folders). Keep your `CNAME` file.
3. Click **Commit changes**, wait a minute, then press Ctrl+F5 on shantisirc.com.
4. Delete old files you no longer need (`style.css`, `script.js`, `logo.jpg`) by opening each file, clicking the trash-can icon and committing.

**One-time setup:** open `js/data.js` and check `repo` near the bottom. `owner` is your GitHub username and `repo` is your repository name (shown at the top of the repository page as `username / repo`). If it is not `shantisirc.github.io`, change it. This lets the gallery, news and projects folders work.

## Add things WITHOUT editing code
Do these on github.com in your repository, then click **Commit changes**. The site updates in about a minute.

- **Gallery photos:** open the `gallery` folder → **Add file → Upload files** → drag photos in. The file name becomes the caption (`robotics-workshop.jpg` shows as "Robotics workshop").
- **News post:** open the `news` folder → **Add file → Create new file**. Name it like `2026-11-05 Robotics workshop.txt` (date first, then the title) and write the news inside. Optional photo: upload `2026-11-05 Robotics workshop.jpg`.
- **Project:** open the `projects` folder → create `Line Follower Robot.txt` with a short description. Optional photo: `Line Follower Robot.jpg`.
- **Remove something:** open the file, click the trash-can icon, then commit.

The "Projects" and "Photos" numbers on the home page update by themselves.

## Edit the text (in `js/data.js`)
- **Join form link:** `JOIN_URL` (every Join button uses it).
- **Board members, ID numbers, photos:** the `board` list. Photos go in `img/`.
- **Built-in news and events from Facebook:** the `events` list.
- **Mission, vision, values, programs, FAQs, advisors:** the `about`, `programs`, `faqs` and `advisors` lists. The mission, vision and values are drafts, so please change them to the club's own words.
- **Advisors:** add people to `advisors` and they appear on the Team page.

## ID cards
Open **Team** and click a member. The card flips, and visitors can download it. The images in `id-cards/` were made from the current board data. If you change a name, role or photo, ask for the images to be made again (the on-screen cards update by themselves).

## Colors
Edit the values at the top of `css/base.css`.
